Hi !

My name is Or Winik and I am the developer that made HarelCohenFit which is a fitness app built with React native, designed to help users track their workouts, meals, and daily nutrient intake. The app includes features like:

1. A workout tracker with customizable exercises, sets, reps, and weights.
2. A meal diary for logging daily meals and calculating nutritional values (protein, carbs, fats).
3. Cloud save integration for syncing and storing data across devices.

The code is open for everyone besides an index file which has personal data so feel free to use it enjoy !
